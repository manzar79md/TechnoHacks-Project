Deployment Issues
If you're getting a 404 error, here are a few things you can check:

File Paths:

Ensure that all file paths (e.g., for CSS, JavaScript, images) are relative and correctly referenced. Check that all resources (like style.css, bg.png, etc.) are in the correct folders.
Check GitHub Pages Settings:

Go to your repository on GitHub.
Navigate to the Settings tab.
Scroll down to GitHub Pages and make sure the source is set to the correct branch (usually main or master) and the root folder for your project is selected.
Case Sensitivity:

GitHub Pages is case-sensitive, so make sure the file and folder names match exactly with the references in your HTML.
Ensure Files Are Pushed:

Check that all files are correctly committed and pushed to your GitHub repository. You can verify this by visiting your repository on GitHub and confirming that all files are present.
